# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js has become one of the most popular frameworks for building modern web applications. In this post, I'll share my experience with Next.js and why I chose it for my personal website.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and initial page load performance
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Fast page loads and reduced server costs
3. **File-based Routing**: Intuitive and easy to understand
4. **API Routes**: Build API endpoints right in your Next.js app

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

Getting started with Next.js is straightforward:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Key Features

### 1. File-based Routing

Next.js uses the file system for routing. For example:
- `pages/index.js` → `/`
- `pages/about.js` → `/about`
- `pages/blog/[slug].js` → `/blog/:slug`

### 2. API Routes

Create API endpoints easily:

```typescript
// pages/api/hello.ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello World!' })
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for modern web development. It provides a great developer experience while ensuring optimal performance for users.
